# Welcome! :runner:  

In the words of Eliud Kipchoge, arguably the greatest living marathoner:  
> Only the disciplined ones in life are free. If you are undisciplined, you are a slave to your moods and your passions.  

This repository is a "discipline endeavor" for me to:
* improve my coding skills in R and Python
* refine my working knowledge of Git, markdown, and the GitHub interface
* showcase this knowledge to anyone who might be interested
* create an interactive space where I can learn and improve  

### About this repository  
This repository contains some lighthearted statistical and dataviz tomfoolery based on major world marathon win times for six races across the US, Europe, and Japan, spanning 1897-2018.  

### How to contribute/interact  
I love learning new things, so please post an issue to point out any error in my code or to offer constructive suggestions!  

### Plans for this repository  
- [x] add simple R code without markdown
- [ ] add a pretty, knitted R-markdown file and its .rmd
- [ ] add equivalent code in Python
